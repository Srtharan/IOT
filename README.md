NodeMCU ESP8266 

The Wi-Fi communication medium is utilised in the project, where NodeMCU ESP8266 (SoC) obtains sensor data and forwards it to the internet. The data from gas sensor (MQ-2), flame sensor and humidity sensor (DHT-11) are projected dynamically on the Web and the Telegram Bot notifies the user whenever a fire is being detected by the system.
